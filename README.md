A web-based platform designed to visualize the data.

This app was created as part of the Data Acquisition and Integration course at [Kasetsart University](https://www.ku.ac.th).

## Overview

This project aims to analyze the impact of traffic conditions on a driver's stress levels using real-time heart rate data combined with traffic data. By collecting heart rate data from a sensor, and traffic data from an external API, we aim to correlate how congestion, speed, and other traffic factors influence physiological responses during a drive.

## Data source

1. Primary Data

   - Heartrate of driver from smart watch
   - Location (latitude, longtitude) of driver

2. Secondary Data
   - Traffic condition from [TomTom Traffic APIs](https://www.tomtom.com/products/traffic-apis/)

## Features

### HeartOnTheRoad UI provides:

1. Trip Dashboard: See trip duration, heart rate stats, traffic time, and map.
2. Traffic Dashboard: View real-time traffic data with heart rate and speed distributions.
3. Time Dashboard: Analyze hourly heart rate and traffic metrics.
4. Analytics: Get overall summaries, traffic breakdowns, heart rate trends with speed.
